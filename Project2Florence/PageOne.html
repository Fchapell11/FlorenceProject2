  <h3>Thanks to JennysStudies</h3>
		<h4>Published on September 6th, 2006</h4>
		<p1>It's been a stressful 2 days, and I couldn't have gotten though them without the help of fellow blogger JennysStudies. </p1>	
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2> I'm not sure how effective this will even be, given the difference in readers of our blogs, but start reading <a href="PageTwo.html">Jenny's blog</a> as well as mine-- she really deserves it.</p2>
