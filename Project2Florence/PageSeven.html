<h>My friend has been bullied</h>
<h2>Published on September 4th, 2006</h2>
	<p> Hello readers! With my platform, I feel like I have to adress some serious wrongdoing on part of a certain member of this community, SpaceReviewer. </p>
	<br>
	<p1>Recently, my friend, PlanetSurfer, has been <a href="PageSix.html" title="Proof">harassed</a> by the afforementioned SpaceReviewer for simple disagreements. I want to use my influence in this section of the internet to state that it is never okay to bully anyone, especially behind a screen.</p1>
	<br><br>
	<p2>Please show some love to <a href="PageOne.html">PlanetSurfer</a>, she genuenly could use it right about now.</p2>
