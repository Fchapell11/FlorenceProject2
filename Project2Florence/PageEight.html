  <h3>Hurt. (2)</h3>
	<h4>Published on September 5th, 2006</h4>
		<p1>I'm doing much better now, but I'm still shook from this whole expirience. All I can say at the moment is how thankful I am that I have such a loving community of bloggers around me. Thank you. Once I saw SpaceReviewer's posts I immiedately felt targeted, as if a giant weight had been placed on my back. I'm starting to recover now.</p1>
